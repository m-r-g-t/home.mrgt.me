# Introduction

My relationship with crypto has been a troubled one, for I fluctuate between amazement and disdain. I hope you enjoy the coming pieces, where I will make an attempt at accomodating some of my thoughts on the state of this technology, community, and short-term future.

I was certainly not the earliest entrant to this tech, for I only first heard of its existence near the 2017 bull market peak, and began playing an active role in closely after the 2020 dump. I have, however, spent a number of days on WebArchives, taking a look at failed projects, trends, and narratives. Few trendy currencies in each bull run survived aside BTC, and so many failed trends became meaningless after a few months. What was once ICOs, is now an NFT, a DAO, or your interoperability talk. Fiat flows are rarely led by value, but by speculation. 

- Constant failed promises - the structural overpromise and underdelivery. The stories of BTC, ETH, ADA.
- The Poppies, the dot-com crash, and other bubbles.
- The idiocy and brilliance underlying NFTs
- tautologies in crypto: the ignorance in DeFi.
- the paradox of tps: centralisation and .
- counterintuitive generalisations on environmental impact: and the increasing rise of PoS as yet another trendy word.

In true crypto fashion, I may miss out some of these ideas. Check back in a couple of weeks, or follow me on twitter @0x_rxx for some real-time updates :)
