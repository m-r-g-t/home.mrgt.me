I'm Marco, a recent Economics with Computing graduate. Originally from Argentina, and now living in the UK. I do know basic French too, *mais j'amerais en apprendre plus de Ã§a!*

Some of my ongoing projects: 
- Crypto, though my interests in the space particular aren't monetary. I've recently begun a Solidity course, for which I may in future.
- Economics. I'm creating a podcast with friends: <a href="https://www.economics.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> WTF Economics!? </a>
- Data science and econometrics. I will soon find some projects in this space - for now, I am learning SQL, numpy, and some econometric techniques.
- Upcycling old tech. I reject succumbing to planned obsolescence, so repair and try to give a new life to older technology. Thus, I prefer using FOSS and GNULinux wherever viable.
- Photography and traveling. I enjoy capturing different cultures and places. I tend to keep them to myself. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pensive.nomad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here are some of my landscapes </a>.
